                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>www.channel2u.net</strong> is a newly developed website with a sole objective of being the life partner of a child; the icon of a family. We went live on 15 August 2015 and our objective of providing fun, quality educational activities and original games competition will be our fundamental platform. 
<br> We aim to be the biggest active kids’ database network in Malaysia

                        Our Coverage</h4>
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Our primary four areas of focus would be on Channel viewing which covers whatever relevant and interesting for kids and family of all ages. Then we have the main catalyst of Education which covers all across 5 to 17 year olds for a start and would include tertiary levels as we progress. Hobby section would be of interest and excitement and finally Contest, the key rewarding section for children and also users of all ages. 
<br>
<br>We would be incorporating live coverage and recorded programmes exclusive from <strong>channel2u</strong> and other related partners.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Besides arranged activities requiring physical presence we would be hosting various online competitions non-stop to achieve our strategic stand of <strong>having</strong> <strong>winners annually, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily</strong>! This will be the first of its kind in Malaysia. 
<br>
<br>Annual events and activities will be key to our schedule and besides original contents we will be looking to many partners for joint campaigns and significant pursuit. 
<br>
<br>We believe the <strong>Channel2U</strong> motto, “<strong>Your channel for life</strong>”; takes a dual mission of being the kid’s partner as he or she grows and also an avenue for them to understand and value their journey of life.</p>
